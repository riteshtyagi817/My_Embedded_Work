Details on RPM spec Sections
The Header Section
The Header section is a list assignments, of the format:

1
Attribute: Value
An example showing the attributes usually used is provided below:

12345678910111213
Summary: A great application!
Name: my_app
Version: 1.0
Release: 2
License: GPLv2
Group: Applications/Text
Source: ftp://ftp.myserver.com/pub/my_app/my_app-1.0.tgz
URL: https://www.myserver.com/my_app/index.html
Vendor: The Best Software Company
Packager: A genius <genius@myserver.com>

The Name, Version, and Release values are used to construct the names of the source and binary RPM files. Most other values are fairly self-explanatory, and can be chosen at will by the packager.

Note that the License field was called Copyright in earlier versions of RPM.


The description Section
The description section is completely free form. To see the description of an existing package, try rpm -qi package. An example description:

123
%description
This program enables the user to do everything that could
possibly be useful under Linux.

The prep Section
The prep section of the header must take the tar file of the source code, unpack it, and then apply any patch files needed. Often, this section is extremely short. An example prep section would be:

12345
%prep
rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_DIR/my_app-1.0
tar zxvf $RPM_SOURCE_DIR/my_app-1.0.tar.gz
patch -p1 < my_app-1.0.patch1
patch -p2 < my_app-1.0.patch2
Modern versions of rpmbuild do not use such detailed prep sections. They can simply do:

123
%prep
%setup -q
%autosetup

The changelog Section
The changelog section lists a history of changes to the package. For example:

123456
%changelog
* Tue Feb 29 2001 Mr Somebody <sbody@foo.com>
- important fix: cleaned up a bug that trashed the filesystem.
     
* Tue Feb 15 2001 Another Somebody <abody@foo.com>
- made minor changes to the initialization routine.

The build Section
The build section contains the commands needed to build your program. If your prep section did its work correctly, this should be one command:

12
%build
make

The install Section
The install section copies files to their final place in the filesystem. This is run after building the binaries, but not when the package is installed. When the binary is built, RPM will automatically package up the files that were put in place by the install section, then during installation, it will copy them back.

Usually, developers put an install target into makefiles that do this copying, which makes the install section of the spec file simple:

12
%install
make install

The files Section
The files section of the spec file lists all of the files that the install section copied into place. Files may be prefixed by an adjective that changes how RPM treats these files. The possible adjectives are:

Adjective

Description

%doc

Marks documentation from the source package to be included in a binary install. Multiple documents can be listed on the same line, or on separate lines. If no path for a documentation file is specified, then it will be put in a directory named /usr/share/doc/package-version-build. 

%config

Mark configuration files. When you uninstall a package, any configuration files which have been changed will be saved with a .rpmsave extension.

%dir

By default, if you include a directory in the files section, the directory and all files it contains are put in as part of installation. Using %dir means that only the directory, and not the files that it contains, will be copied when the package is installed.

%attr

Set attributes for the file. An example would be %attr(666,root,root), where the three fields are mode, owner, and group (just like the output of ls -l). Defaults are gotten by using a - in a place.

%defattr

The same as %attr, but you do not add a file to it. Instead, all files listed after the %defattr will automatically get the new attributes (unless they have their own %attr directive).

An example files section would be:

123456
%files
%doc README
/usr/bin/my_app
%config /usr/bin/my_app_configure
/usr/man/man/my_app.1
%attr(600,-,root) /usr/lib/my_app/my_data
