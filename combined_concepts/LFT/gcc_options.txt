The compiled code format will be ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), which makes using shared libraries easy; the older a.out format, while obsolete (although the name a.out survives, confusingly, as the default name for an output file), may still be used if the Linux kernel has been configured to support it.

Here is a list of some of the main options that can be given to gcc:

Compiler Path Options

Compiler Path Options
Option

Description

-I dir

Include dir in search for included files; cumulative

-L dir

Search dir for libraries; cumulative

-l

Link to lib; -lfoo links to libfoo.so if it exists, or to libfoo.a as a second choice

Compiler Preprocessor Options
Option

Description

-M

Do not compile; give dependencies for make

-H

Print out names of included files

-E

Preprocess only

-D def

Define def

-U def

Undefine def

-d

Print #defines

Compiler Warning Options
Option

Description

-v

Verbose mode, gives version number

-pedantic

Warn very verbosely

-w

Suppress warnings

-W

More verbose warnings

-Wall

Enable a bunch of important warnings


Compiler Debugging and Profiling Options
Option

Description

-g

Include debugging information

-pg

Provide profile information for gprof


Compiler Input and Output Options
Option

Description

-c

Stop after creating object files, do not link

-o file

Output is file ; default is a.out

-x lang

Expect input to be in lang, which can be c, objective-c, c++ (and some others); otherwise, guess by input file extension


Compiler Control Options
Option

Description

-ansi

Enforce full ANSI compliance

-pipe

Use pipes between stages

-static

Suppress linking with shared libraries

-O[lev]

Optimization level; 0, 1, 2, 3; default is 0

-Os

Optimize for size; use all -O2 options except those that increase the size

A good set of options to use is:

1
-O2 -Wall -pedantic
Make sure you understand any warnings; if you take the effort to obliterate them, you might save yourself a lot of debugging. However, do not use -pedantic when compiling code for the Linux kernel, which uses many gcc extensions.
