echo displays (echoes) text. It is used simply, as in:

1
$ echo string
echo can be used to display a string on standard output (i.e. the terminal) or to place in a new file (using the > operator) or append to an already existing file (using the >> operator).

The â€“e option, along with the following switches, is used to enable special character sequences, such as the newline character or horizontal tab.

\n represents newline

\t  represents horizontal tab

echo is particularly useful for viewing the values of environment variables (built-in shell variables). For example, echo $USERNAME will print the name of the user who has logged into the current terminal.

The following table lists echo commands and their usage:
