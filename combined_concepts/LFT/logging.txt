System log files are essential for monitoring and troubleshooting. In Linux, these messages appear in various files under /var/log.

Ultimate control of how messages are dealt with is controlled by the syslogd daemon (usually rsyslogd on modern systems) common to many UNIX-like operating systems. The newer systemd-based systems can use journalctl instead, but usually retain syslogd and cooperate with it.

Important messages are sent not only to the logging files, but also to the system console window; if you are not running X or are at a virtual terminal, you will see them directly there as well. In addition, these messages will be copied to /var/log/messages (or to /var/log/syslog on Ubuntu), but if you are running X, you have to take some steps to view them.

A good way to see them is to open a terminal window, and in that window, type tail -f /var/log/messages. On a GNOME desktop, you can also access the messages by clicking on System > Administration > System Log or Applications > System Tools > Log File Viewer in your Desktop menus, and other desktops have similar links you can locate.

In order to keep log files from growing without bound, the logrotate program is run periodically and keeps four previous copies (by default) of the log files (optionally compressed) and is controlled by /etc/logrotate.conf.

Here are some of the important log files found under /var/log:
