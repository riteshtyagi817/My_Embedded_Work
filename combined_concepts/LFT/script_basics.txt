If foobar.sh is:

4
#!/bin/bash
echo 0 = $0
echo 1 = $1
echo ’*’ = $*
the output of ./foobar.sh a b c d e is:

123
0 = ./foobar
1=a 
*=abcde
Inside the script, the command shift n shifts the arguments n times (to the left).

There are two ways to include a script file inside another script:

. file

source file.

There are a number of options that can be used for debugging purposes:

set -n (bash -n) just checks for syntax

set -x (bash -x) echos all commands after running them

set -v (bash -v) echos all commands before running them

set -u (bash -u) causes the shell to treat using unset variables as an error

set -e (bash -e) causes the script to exit immediately upon any non-zero exit status

where the set command is used inside the script (with a + sign behavior is reversed) and the second form, giving an option to bash, is invoked when running the script from the command line.
