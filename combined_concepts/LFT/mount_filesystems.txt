In UNIX-like operating systems, all files are arranged in one big filesystem tree rooted at /. Many different partitions on many different devices may be coalesced together by mounting partitions on various mount points, or directories in the tree.

The full form of the mount command is:

1
$ sudo mount [-t type] [-o options] device dir
In most cases, the filesystem type can be deduced automatically from the first few bytes of the partition, and default options can be used, so it can be as simple as:

1
$ sudo mount /dev/sda8 /usr/local
Most filesystems need to be loaded at boot and the information required to specify mount points, options, devices, etc., is specified in /etc/fstab:


Note that in this example, most of the filesystems are mounted by label; it is also possible to mount by device name or UUID; the following are all equivalent:

54321
$ sudo mount /dev/sda2   /boot
$ sudo mount LABEL=boot  /boot
$ sudo mount    -L boot  /boot
$ sudo mount UUID=26d58ee2-9d20-4dc7-b6ab-aa87c3cfb69a /boot
$ sudo mount   -U 26d58ee2-9d20-4dc7-b6ab-aa87c3cfb69a /boot
The list of currently mounted filesystems can be seen with:

12345678910111213141516171819
$ sudo mount
/dev/sda5 on / type ext3 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
/dev/sda6 on /RHEL6-32 type ext3 (rw)
/dev/mapper/VGN-local on /usr/local type ext4 (rw)
/dev/mapper/VGN-tmp on /tmp type ext4 (rw)
/dev/mapper/VGN-src on /usr/src type ext4 (rw)
/dev/mapper/VGN-virtual on /VIRTUAL type ext4 (rw)

If a directory is used as a mount point, its previous contents are hidden under the newly mounted filesystem. A given partition can be mounted in more than one place and changes are effective in all locations.

You can also mount NFS (Network File Systems) as in:
