sort is used to rearrange the lines of a text file either in ascending or descending order, according to a sort key. You can also sort by particular fields of a file. The default sort key is the order of the ASCII characters (i.e. essentially alphabetically).

sort can be used as follows:

Syntax

Usage

sort <filename>

Sort the lines in the specified file, according to the characters at the beginning of each line

cat file1 file2 | sort

Combine the two files, then sort the lines and display the output on the terminal

sort -r <filename>

Sort the lines in reverse order

sort -k 3 <filename>

Sort the lines by the 3rd field on each line instead of the beginning

When used with the -u option, sort checks for unique values after sorting the records (lines). It is equivalent to running uniq (which we shall discuss) on the output of sort.
