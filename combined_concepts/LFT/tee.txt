tee takes the output from any command, and, while sending it to standard output, it also saves it to a file. In other words, it "tees" the output stream from the command: one stream is displayed on the standard output and the other is saved to a file.

For example, to list the contents of a directory on the screen and save the output to a file, at the command prompt type ls -l | tee newfile and press the Enter key.

Typing cat newfile will then display the output of ls â€“l.
